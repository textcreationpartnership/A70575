            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99906:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>as to their publick Vindication from thoſe many and ſcandalous aſperſions in all this time, but (like a Company of ſtout valiant men, that I may uſe <hi>Tully</hi>'s Ironical Language in his <hi>Orat. in Catilin. Nos autem viri fortes ſatisfacere Reip. videmur, ſi.</hi>—) have ſatisfied themſelves to acquieſce in modeſt ſilence; which hath made the Criminator pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſtill to inſult over them, willing to make the world believe that their ſilence ſpeaks them really guilty. The conſideration hereof hath prevail'd with me now at laſt, though an unfit perſon, and contrary to my <hi>Genius,</hi> yet being a real well-wiſher to both the Societies of Phyſick and Pharmacy, to endeavour to vindicate the cauſe of the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (though not at all commiſſionated by them) and to evidence to the World, that all is not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which the Criminator hath alledged. And though poſſibly I may be called Ignorant-fellow, and Illiterate-fool for my pains, (and indeed I pretend not higher) nor do I expect leſs from the Criminator, <hi>Nolo altum ſapere:</hi> yet Children and Fools often times ſpeak truth (if our <hi>Engliſh</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb be true, which I ſhall endeavour to make good.) Therefore that I may according to that ſmall capacity I have ſhoot that Fools bolt of mine in ſome meaſure to clear the Company from thoſe aſperſions unjuſtly charged upon them, I ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon it, not willing to deliver any thing which may give any juſt offence to either Society, but rather (if it be not too much preſumption in me to hope to bring about) to create a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding betwixt them, but

               <q>— Haud equidem tali me dignor honore.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Tis true, I am no Philoſopher, nor yet pretender to Learning, and therefore <hi>(impar congreſſus,)</hi> and more cannot be expected from me at beſt, than truth and plain <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Order to this enſuing Vindication I do ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and really declare.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is not in my thoughts to vindicate any private perſon, member of the Company of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, in any unlawful action, or uncivil deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards any of that Honorable Society of the Colledge of Phyſicians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor ſhall I go about to countenance any members of that Corporation to take upon them the practice of Phyſick, but to adviſe them rather to keep within their lawful bounds, and to mind their own buſineſs, and employment, which they have been, or at leaſt ſhould have been, bred up to, and verſed in; <hi>Quam quiſ<expan>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> nôrit artem, in eâ ſe exerceat, &amp; in eâ verſetur.</hi> Let them not act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what reaſon and the known Laws of the Land will bear them out in; <hi>Tractent Fabrilia Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri;</hi> And let them not entrench upon the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians profeſſion, but in all lawful ways, ſo far as becomes them, be ſubſervient to them in all their rational commands and preſcripts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither ſhall I plead for ſuch as are diſhoneſt or negligent in their own profeſſion. I doubt not, but that the Company of Apothecaries will be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and induſtrious to find out, and diſcover all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99906:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſuch perſons, <hi>ut poenas luant debitas,</hi> to puniſh ſuch according to their merits, as far as their power will extend.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor ſhall I preſume in the leaſt <hi>(longè longè abſit!)</hi> to derogate from, or leſſen th' authority, or preheminence of that Honorable Society of the Colledge of Phyſicians, which they may juſtly claim over th' Apothecaries, grounded upon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Law, Equity and Reaſon. And ſo much I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume hath ever been and will be acknowledged by the Company, who are as unwilling to entrench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or infringe, any of the juſt Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of that Honorable Society, as they are willing and ready and obliged to preſerve their own: and are ready to hearken to any expedient for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the unhappy differences betwixt the two Societies. I hope it will not lie at their doors (as I hear ſome of the chief of them ſay) if there be not a happy concurrence; <hi>faxit Deus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having therefore now declared, what I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline in theſe following lines, I ſhall take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to make it my buſineſs as well to doe the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Society of Phyſicians right, as to vindicate the Company of Apothecaries and the honeſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof from thoſe Criminations of the Worthy Doctor, and to invalidate his Allegations and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, together with his <hi>Only Remedy.</hi> And this I ſhall endeavour to do by offering ſome Short and Modeſt Animadverſions upon them, or at leaſt upon ſuch of them, as are moſt material for the world to take notice of. And then <hi>ſub Judice Lis eſt</hi> Let all Judicious ſober perſons judg where the miſtake lies.</p>

There came forth in Print ſome Months ſince a ſevere Treatiſe Entituled <hi>A ſhort View, &amp;c.</hi> as in the Title Page — Wherein the Author hath not only been ſo free with th'Apothecaries, as to call them <hi>Illiterate fellows, liars, diſhoneſt, pittiful fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, pittiful Ignorant ſouls, praters</hi> and what not: but alſo hath taken upon him to aſperſe moſt of his own profeſſion, who are in the general, perſons of known Integrity, Learning, Sobriety and honour; ſome of them he entitles, <hi>unworthy Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, covetous, wanting parts; neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous perſons;</hi> as appears in his fourteenth page of his firſt Edition. Others he accuſeth of <hi>Lazineſs, Ignorance, want of will to do good for the ſick:</hi> pag. 68. of his ſecond Edition. Nor is it the firſt time that the Worthy Doctor hath vented his diſpleaſure againſt ſome of the moſt Eminent Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the Colledge, though contrary to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and intention, nor much to his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or their detriment. But why worthy Doctor ſo angry at your Colleagues? Why ſo cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious upon ſuch of them as do not comply with your deſign that they muſt be admoniſh'd? Have they need of ſuch a Monitor? In good time <hi>Domine</hi> Doctor, <hi>Eóne Imprudentiae ventum eſt?</hi> a little more prudence in my opinion might have done you no hurt. And therefore as a Learned Doctor in Phyſick and a Colleague hath candidly, yet modeſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf lately to the like purpoſe. <hi>I would not have you think,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am now juſtifying every member of our Society in every thing. We are not (perhaps) all prudent and good
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99906:5"/>natur'd men.</hi> I conceive that to be the ſence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more of that Colleague, as alſo I doubt not but that he ſpeaks the ſence of the reſt of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Society in the ſame particular, to whom the Criminator is ſufficiently known with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment.</p>
            <p>But theſe things are but preliminary. I ſhall now according to promiſe make ſome Modeſt Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions in order as I find them, that require an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in his frontiſpice, or title page, I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of theſe enſuing words, <hi>A ſhort view of the Frauds and Abuſes of the Apothecaries</hi> &amp;c. and of <hi>the Only Remedy thereof by Phyſicians making their own Medicines.</hi> I fear Worthy Doctor that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> proverb may here be veriſied, that <hi>The Remedy will prove worſe than the diſeaſe,</hi> and I hope I ſhall make it appear. Next in the ſame title page in the cloſe of it, the Worthy Doctor quotes an ancient Diſtich <hi>in Medicaſtros,</hi> againſt Mountebanks,

            <p>I ſhall not undertake or preſume to put any eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99906:6"/>upon the Worthy Doctors proficiency in his thirty years practice, neither how ſucceſsful or unſucceſsful he hath been in all this time (it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove my Sphere to determine;) but ſhall rather refer the Reader to ſomething lately publiſhed by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent knowing perſon of the ſame faculty, who is able to make right judgement in the caſe, and it is <hi>totidem verbis;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we might take an eſtimate of his parts from his writings, 't was manifeſt he might better employ his time in ſtudying the Method of Phyſick than in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Medicaments: that after thirty years pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice 'twas evident he underſtood not the Rudiments of that Noble Science, nor could ſtate a caſe therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I paſs that, not willing to recriminate, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliate, but modeſtly and calmly to endeavour to vindicate the Apothecaries from the Worthy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's uncivil and unkind reflexions.</p>
            <p>In the next page he proceeds to Apologize for himſelf,<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note> telling you what a <hi>publick ſpirited man</hi> he is, and that he hath no other deſign but the <hi>good</hi> of his Country men, and to do Mankind good by reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his profeſſion to it's ancient and deſerved honor.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Quid verba audio cum facta videam?</hi> To what purpoſe do I hear words, againſt actions that are point blank to the contrary? 'Tis in plain tearms no more than <hi>Verba dare,</hi> which is in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> no leſs than to deceive and delude.</p>

And that he may put the better gloſs upon the ſharpneſs of his writings, he would make you believe he does but ſpeak the Common language of all Phyſicians, wherein certainly the Colledge of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians are very little beholding to him, and certainly he deſerves to be called to a <hi>Redde rationem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place he tells you of a book that came forth from an <hi>Inquiſitive</hi> perſon the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the ſame Subject, which becauſe the Company of Apothecaries have not given anſwer to, he takes it <hi>pro conceſſo,</hi> that their ſilence hath rendred it Authentick. But why, from an <hi>Inquiſitive</hi> perſon? <hi>Cum vides velatam, quid inquiris in rem abſconditam?</hi> but I conceive the Worthy Doctor put him upon this Inquiſition intending to make uſe of him as his <hi>Prodromus,</hi> but it ſeems he came ſhort, as he intimates, and was not Satyriſt enough as the Worthy Doctor conceiv'd, and therefore himſelf will undertake to make it up, and to ſtrike the nail home to the head. So that I ſhall wave to return any anſwer to that, nor did the Company of Apothecaries think it convenient to anſwer it, unwilling to engage in any quarrel of that nature without further provocations; conceiving that any ſober perſon might eaſily diſcover the ſcope and drift of it. And beſides 'tis probable that the <hi>Inquiſitive</hi> perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a young Doctor, or at that time no Doctor but a Student in Phyſick, might not ſpeak ſo much his own ſence as the ſence of ſome ſuch Suborner, who might be willing to make uſe of him to break the Ice, like as 'tis in the ſtory of the Ape, that made uſe of the young Catling's foot to pull the roaſted Cheſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99906:7"/>out of the ſire, not willing to burn his own Paw. Beſides this <hi>Inquiſitive</hi> perſon did it as himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges <hi>currenti calamo</hi> in haſte, and though the perſon be an Ingenious Learned man, yet we know the old proverb, <hi>Canis feſtinans</hi> — I wiſh he had taken the advice of ſome more conſiderate, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Judicious perſon before the publiſhing: I believe it might have turn'd to a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>The Worthy Doctor goes on, hoping to prove that theſe abuſes complain'd of, as he ſaith, by all ſorts of perſons, ariſe from this only cauſe that Phyſicians make not their own Medicines, <hi>Exitus acta probat.</hi> — ſtill he proceeds. —</p>
            <p>But before I deſcend to particulars I ſhall firſt lay down this Propoſition,<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> their own confeſſion, and in their own Language, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>they may be the veryeſt knaves in</hi> England. <hi>Becauſe they may put in bad Ingredients, and more or leſs, or ſubſtitute one thing for another; and all this without being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and conſequently not to be puniſhed — Quid inde?</hi> What doth the Doctor infer from hence? How doth this advance your cauſe? <hi>Novimus &amp; qui te</hi> — If the Doctor takes the <hi>Knave</hi> Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries trade upon him; this puts in bad Ingredients, and the Doctor may put in worſe with leſs ſuſpicion of being detected, having no ſuperviſor; he may ſay as <hi>Cato</hi> once, when he had got the Sword in his own hands, and no body with him, <hi>Sum mei Juris;</hi> he may be his own Carver. Whereas the <hi>Knave</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary hath not only ſervants whoſe eyes are ſtill upon him, but Cenſors of the Colledge, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99906:7"/>Wardens of the Company to ſearch and call to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; ſo that for fear, if not for conſcience, he may prove the honeſter man. <hi>Turpe eſt Doctori</hi> —</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hoc ſuppoſito,</hi> that the Doctor hath more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be as bad, or worſe, than the <hi>Knave</hi> Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, what hinders then according to his own infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that it may not as clearly follow, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deceit covetous wits can invent, may at leaſt be ſuſpected to be uſed by the Good Doctor? If there be not the ſame reaſon for the one, as for the other let the world judge. And by the ſame conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence what great reaſon I pray will there be for any future Allegations of the Doctors to gain belief? And here it ſeems he hath done with the poſſibility of an Apothecaries being the <hi>veryeſt Knave</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and I alſo have given my thoughts in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> of the probability of the Doctors outſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the <hi>Knave</hi> Apothecary, by reaſon of his better opportunity, and leſs fear of being detected.</p>

               <hi>Hoc nihil ad Rhombum!</hi> This is plain enough to be a piece of pure Envy, <hi>Invidus alterius rebus</hi> —</p>
            <p>Next in order he ranks up the frauds by them committed, as,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>They uſe Medicines quite contrary to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>They falſifie the grand Compoſitions of the</hi> London Diſpenſatory, <hi>and put them not to open view</hi> —</item>
            </list>
            <p>I believe there may be ſome ſuch perſons, that may be ſo diſhoneſt as to uſe theſe indirect ways, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99906:8"/>are ſo crafty by their ſubterfuges as to evade the ſearches both of the Colledge and the Company of Apothecaries, who are Authoriſed to that end; but what is this to purpoſe? grant it to be ſo! ſhall the whole Profeſſion with the honeſt Profeſſors thereof ſuffer therefore? and their good Name Trade and Lively hood, ſhall they be taken away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are <hi>Knaves</hi> of the ſame Profeſſion? Nay I conceive rather that honeſt men ought to be the more valued, and the Corporation, which do their endeavour by all the beſt meansthey can to diſcover any ſuch frauds, and to puniſh the Authors, ought to be never the leſs eſteemed.</p>
            <p>So alſo for the <hi>Sophiſtication of Chymical Oyls,</hi> which he ſeems in the general to charge upon the Chymiſts. I ſhall in brief let him know that there be many Apothecaries deſtil them themſelves and make all their Chymical preparations, which are in uſe. And the Company is now <hi>inter aedificandum</hi> a preparing a Laboratory as I am informed, that ſuch as have not conveniencies at home to prepare ſuch things, may have them faithfully prepared there, where care will be taken of the honeſt and faithful preparing of them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This is ſomething Doctor that you ſay, that I ſhall not oppoſe you in. But what doth this concern ſuch as make all their Compoſitions themſelves, or buy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99906:8"/>them at leaſt of ſuch Retail Apothecaries as they know to make them faithfully, and truſt not to the Whole-ſaleſhops at all? and ſuch I conceive are moſt Apothecaries who have any conſiderable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. If any do otherwiſe, I plead not for them; though I doubt not but there may be ſome Whole-ſale Apothecaries honeſt men, and ſuch as make good Medicines faithfully, <hi>Caveat Emptor!</hi> Let the Countrey Apothecary, or any other that are enforced to make uſe of them endeavour to pick out the honeſteſt, though not the cheapeſt!</p>

               </note> and to the ninth, I ſhall ſay no more, but <hi>Riſum teneatis amici,</hi> who can forbear laughing at the Seedman and the Worthy Doctors man? But,
<q>Quid domini facient, audent cum talia fures?</q>
            </p>
            <p>If the Doctors man be ſo bold as to bring ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioulous tales home to his Maſter, what will not the Worthy Doctor himſelf do to encourage him further and to make it good?</p>

               <hi>By reaſon that more frauds may be committed by the Apothecaries than by any other Trade, and by ſuppoſition that gain will tempt moſt men — I ſay that this ſeems to be the cauſe, why they have two Superviſors ſet over them more than any other Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that if gain will tempt moſt men to diſhoneſt actions, eſpecially when they may act undiſcovered, the Worthy Doctor is a man, and a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99906:9"/>man that loves gain as appears, and why may not he more eaſily be tempted to diſhoneſt actions? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he may act alone, having turn'd the <hi>Knave</hi> Apothecary off, and having no Superviſors ſet over him, neither Cenſors of the Colledge, nor Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Wardens of the Apothecaries to detect him. This <hi>Auri Sacra fames</hi> — the Golden-fees I fear may tempt ſuch a man, — <hi>quid non mortalia cogit</hi> —?</p>
            <p>The next thing is th' <hi>enlarging and multiplying their Bills and Medicines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. <hi>14.</hi>
               </note> and this is comprehended in nine Criminations. To the firſt eight I have not much to ſay. The Colledge have power by their Charter to puniſh ſuch as are guilty in that kinde; nor does this concern the Company, who approve not of any ſuch actions, nor do they own them, being not warrantable, nor juſtifiable.</p>
            <p>As to the ninth,<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>15.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>But their principal art of all is to cry up, and bring in to Patients ſuch unworthy Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, who through Covetouſneſs do, or through meanneſs of parts or want muſt, comply with th' Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries intereſt.</hi> Pag. 15. <hi>of the firſt Edition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I reply, that it is no marvel that th' Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries are ſo Criminated, when Phyſicians allowed of by the Colledge ſhall be ſo calumniated by him; and beſides to riſe up to that pitch of Envy, as to deny them ſo much as good Language from th' Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary: they muſt not (forſooth) be call'd <hi>Good Phyſicians.</hi> Now theſe Phyſicians whom this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo much decryes are either Fellows of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or Candidates; however, ſuch as are approv'd of by the Colledge: otherwiſe I preſume the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99906:9"/>would not have conceal'd it. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are Phyſicians, and called <hi>Good</hi> Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and yet higher by ſome, as the Doctor intimates and ſtomacks at, <hi>Good Apothecaries</hi> Phyſicians. Why Doctor? You may poſſibly have as large and high <hi>Encomiums</hi> conferr'd on you, as any of them have. A Phyſician, nay a <hi>Good</hi> Phyſician, a great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher or a great pretender to it, a <hi>Learned</hi> Phyſician. Nay ſince there is a title that the Doctor ſeems to bear himſelfe high upon, <hi>One of the Fellows of the Colledge of Phyſicians</hi> London, and thereupon may think himſelfe undervalued to have his Juniors (which, happily, are no Fellows of the Colledge) to be ſo courted with Good language, and to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beard him that hath been a long time Fellow, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not denied, that he may not be baulked of his due merit; nay 'tis evident enough and without diſpute that he is and hath been a long time a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the Colledge, and poſſibly a <hi>Good</hi> Fellow too; for he hath done many <hi>good</hi> offices for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge intereſt; a <hi>Good</hi> Steward when time was; and therefore why he ſhould be debarr'd of any <hi>Good</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithete, I ſee no reaſon, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The Worthy Doctor is ſtill clamouring againſt the Dear Bills of Apothecaries. This bait he thinks will take beſt, becauſe every body in common prudence would be as ſaving as they may. And I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99906:10"/>cannot ſay but that 'tis commendable ſo to be; but <hi>Incidet in Scyllam qui</hi> — The patient that goes from the Apothecary to this good Doctor for his Medicines or Phyſick, thinking to ſave by it, will certainly, as we ſay, leap out of the frying pan into the fire. Nevertheleſs I ſhall not go about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe any Apothecary, that ſhall in his prices ſet higher rates, than equity and conſcience will allow, as that perſon that made the Patient pay twenty four ſhillings for twenty four ordinary Pills, as Doctor <hi>C. T.</hi> intimates (but ſuch a one is but <hi>è millibus unus;</hi> I have no plea for him, or any ſuch.) Onely thus far I ſhall plead for ſuch Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, as make uſe of the beſt Ingredients, and make their Compoſitions faithfully, and diſpence Phyſicians Bills conſcientiouſly, and in order to perform their truſt are willing to be at any charge though extraordinary, and not to ſtand ſo much upon the dearneſs, as upon the goodneſs and ſoundneſs of the Ingredients, though poſſibly they may coſt three or four times as much as others more frugal and leſs conſcientious do buy for; I ſay then I deſire to be ſatisfied, whether ſuch an Apothecary (and ſuch to my knowledge there be) may not with a ſafe conſcience allow himſelf the liberty of a competent proportionable gain, and the Patient, all things conſidered, no whit injur'd by it. <hi>Eſt modus in rebus — Sit modoſecundùm aequum &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num!</hi> for to buy dear and ſell cheap is not the way to make the pot boil, as we ſay.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99906:11"/>out of their cognizance, and element, who, ſo they may buy cheap, care not what they be ſerved with, or how they are abuſed and cheated. <hi>Penny wiſe</hi> — But we have an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverb, <hi>A Larke is worth a Kite,</hi> which may aſſoon be verified in th'Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries Profeſſion as in any; both to the Buyer and Seller. And I muſt tell you thus much in plain tearms, that an honeſt Apothecary that ſells dear, many times gets leſs by much than ſome others that ſell cheap. And beſides a Learned Doctor in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, <hi>The Accompliſh'd Phyſician,</hi> though he hath not been wanting to contribute in his Laſh to the aſperſing of the Company as well as of <hi>Lex talionis,</hi> yet hath in this point been ſo candid and impartial, <hi>Pag.</hi> 76. as to let the World know,<note place="margin">Ac.

               </note> that the honeſt Apothecary (for he grants there be ſome ſuch) is not onely to be conſidered, and pay'd barely for his Medicines, and Materials which are exhibited, but alſo to have ſome allowance for ſuch things as he provides in readineſs in his Shop for Patients, though they be not made uſe of, but being exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete or decay'd is forced to throw them out of doors, or into the fire: As alſo to have ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for attendance extraordinary, which many times is expected from the Patient, and that at unſeaſonable hours, partly to be ſatisfied in ſome ſcruples of <hi>Regimen,</hi> or poſſibly to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the Phyſician, when he is not at leiſure to viſit the Patient himſelf.</p>
            <p>And further, They that have occaſion to make uſe of Lawyers, &amp; Counſellors, &amp; Sollicitors, about their Eſtates, think it not prudence to ſtarve their

I ſpeak this as to the concerns of the Patient as well to Phyſicians, as Apothecaries, that when they have faithfully performed their truſt and duty as they ought to do, they deſerve as much encouragement from them that had occaſion to make uſe of them, as any members in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth whatſoever. And t'will be no imprudence for the Patients (<hi>bona ſi ſua nôrint,</hi> if they did but really weigh their own intereſt) to conſider it, and not to think to be too great husbands, as we ſay, to either of them in their gratifications. But I ſpeak this onely of ſuch Patients as are of ability to do it. As for the poorer and meaner ſort <hi>ſecundùm magis aut minùs,</hi> I doubt not that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phyſician or Apothecary, honeſt, conſcientious, and expert in their ſeveral Profeſſions, do or will want bowels to extend their Charity, or will be remiſs in their beſtowing their pains <hi>gratìs,</hi> when there is occaſion.<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>19.</hi>

How comes this change about? Is <hi>Saul</hi> alſo among the Prophets? I could not conceive that this Doctor had any time or

But the Grand Criminator alledged Scripture we know to whom; and for this the Worthy Doctor may have his Liberty to quote S. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> Nevertheleſs, I cannot ſay, that I judge it reaſonable, that an Apothecary ſhould repeate a whole courſe of Phyſick, preſcribed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by a Phyſician, without his knowledge or direction, if the Phyſician be <hi>inter vivos,</hi> and may be had, and conſulted; though ſometimes poſſibly a Patient may be very importunate out of frugality to ſave Fees, and their importunity might poſſibly prevail with the Apothecary againſt a mans own inclination. But there may be many alterations in the caſe. And therefore what ever diſaſter ſhould happen upon it (as often it doth or may) th' Apothecary is certainly upon the ſafer and ſurer ground, when he hath a Phyſician's preſcript for his Warrant to juſtifie his actings.

               <hi>that though th' Apothecaries be honeſt (and who can tell which of them is ſo?)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly Good Doctor there are ſome honeſt perſons among them. Is there no ſuch thing <hi>in rerum naturâ?</hi> then let them be diſcarded root and branch! But what if it be made to appear that there are many Apothecaries, who may for honeſty (without any arrogancy be it ſpoken) ſtand in Competition with this great Philoſopher? and that the Good Doctor's queſtion may be eaſily reſolv'd, that he ſhall not need his brother <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> his Lanthorn at noon day to find ſuch a man?</p>
            <p>But the Good Doctor however either cannot, or will not tell where to find ſuch a one: Nay, he will rather endeavour to make him turn <hi>Knave,</hi> and diſhoneſt, <hi>aut Inveniam aut faciam,</hi> if he be not ſo already; and this he doth by proclaiming the dearneſs of their Bills, and making the World believe that their Apothecary ſtuff coſts them little or nothing, and ſo may be ſold for a Song; all clear gains! Whereas if himſelf come to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of them, he will take care according to his promiſe to avoid th' uſe of Chargeable things and in ſtead of them to uſe cheaper: he ſhall not need to trouble himſelf, as he intimates, with Bezoar, Pearls, Sapphyrs, Emeralds, Ambergrieſe, Gold, &amp;c. <hi>Ad quid perditio haec?</hi> theſe will not turn to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he will not caſt Pearls before Swine. Or if he ſhould chance to uſe Pearls, &amp;c. he will put in one grain, or two at moſt for an hundred, as was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99906:14"/>formerly demonſtrated from his own confeſſion. But ſome men have their grains of allowance, and this Good Doctor his hundred; So 'tis an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one but the Doctor is miſtaken in the right and proportional doſe of theſe dear Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, and may poſſibly be willing enough to be ſo miſtaken <hi>lucri gratiâ</hi> for the Patients <hi>gewds,</hi> and to <hi>do Mankind good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But his charge is, that <hi>he commits the care of diſpencing of Medicines to his ſervants, whilſt he is viſiting abroad, or at his recreations.</hi>] And I pray Good Doctor who takes care of diſpencing your Medicines all the other part of the day beſides that half hour that you allot your ſelf for that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?

               <hi>Fees:</hi> Otherwiſe I pray how will this hold water? How do ye think that this Good Doctor muſt live in that handſome equipage, grand porte garb, and attendance, &amp;c. which he tells you are neceſſary concomitants to his Profeſſion, and promiſes himſelf (doubtleſs) to be Maſter of? This is a Paradox indeed, and will need an <hi>Oedipus</hi> to unriddle, and 'tis paſt my skill, <hi>Davus ſum, non Oedipus.</hi> But I crave pardon, I ſee the Good Doctor hath his Expedient for it at hand, as he is pleas'd to communicate it, <hi>pag.</hi> 37. he will cure the Patient by <hi>Well ordering onely, without any remedies at all, or but very few, and thoſe inconſiderable. &amp; Pag.</hi> 36. <hi>He may avoyd all pompous, uſeleſs, chargeable Medicines of the ſhops, and ſubſtitute in their places cheaper: he may very well lay aſide the precious ſtones, Sapphyrs, Emeralds, &amp;c. the high priced Magiſtrals,</hi> as he calls them (he means I ſuppoſe Magiſteries) <hi>of Coral and Pearl, as alſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns horn and Bezoar, and he may alſo ſpare the charges of Leaf-gold for gilding of Pills, Electuaries, &amp;c.</hi> Nay further to make good his aſſertion of the Patients advantage in ſaving char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by giving them their Medicines <hi>gratis,</hi> and to make it out how he can afford to take nothing for them,<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>37.</hi>
               </note> he proceeds, <hi>he ſhall have little uſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, Syrups, Lohochs, &amp;c.</hi> and amongſt other expedients to frugalize his new trade, <hi>he ſhall not need to uſe ſo large Compoſitions, conſiſting of ſuch confus'd and contrary Ingredients; and will find good reaſon to lay aſide thoſe unintelligible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Compoſitions of Mithridate, Treacle, and the ſo much magnified Treacle water.</hi>] Now then I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99906:15"/>am reaſonably well ſatisfied with this expedient of the Good Doctors, which convinces me that he may afford to give his Apothecary ſtuff into the bargain, for he will either give little, or nothing, or elſe nothing to purpoſe; he will feed them at moſt, but with a bit and a knock of any dear reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (I perceive that by him,) even thoſe from whom he expects competent Fees; Nay he makes no bones of it, even to rob th' <hi>Oſpittle</hi> as we ſay. The poor man's Phyſick <hi>Mithridate,</hi> and <hi>Treacle</hi> he would fain cry down; Where then is this Good Doctor's Charity?</p>
            <p>Now as to his ſo much Vilipending the Grand Compoſitions of <hi>Mithridate</hi> and <hi>Treacle</hi> — ſo much magnified and cryed up by moſt Learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians Antient and Modern, I have a word to mind the Doctor of, before thoſe be laid aſide. Poſſibly in thoſe Compoſitions of <hi>Mithridate</hi> and <hi>Treacle</hi> I will not ſay but that ſomething might be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and corrected, and poſſibly ſome more analogous and proper ſubſtitutes in the room of ſuch Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, as were neither in our fathers days, nor are yet in ours to be had, and tautologies and repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of the ſame Ingredients in one Compoſition rectified, as Learned <hi>Zwelfer</hi> hath well obſerved, and done that particular to our hand in part. I ſhall not pretend to make any Apology for them, neither to Magnifie, or Vilifie them, but ſhall leave that to the cenſure of the Honourable Society of the Colledge of Phyſicians as the only and moſt proper Judges in ſuch a caſe. And whether the Compoſitions, or the Good Doctor be more unintelligible, or unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99906:16"/>let ſuch intelligent and reaſonable perſons judge. And beſides Good Doctor, under favour, till better and more proper and intelligible reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies can be thought on, and directed in lieu of them, I conceive it may not be ſo ſeaſonable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry them.

One hundred years ſince, which doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ſome degree, that th' Apothecaries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is not ſo Novel, as the Good Doctor would have it. But to come home to our ſelves concerning theſe things that the Good Doctor would lay aſide, they having been ſo much made uſe of, and that with good ſucceſs to poor people, who are neither able to give the Doctor a Fee, or to pay th' Apothecary, and conſidering that ſo much good hath been done with them by Charitable Ladies and Gentlewomen in the Countries to their poor Neighbourhood, where other or better remedies are not to be had, I do not a little heſitate at the conceit of this Good Doctor. Beſides all this, <hi>A te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris aſſueſcere multum eſt,</hi> It will not be an eaſie matter or a task of a few days to bring the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-people off from their good opinion of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies as they have been long accuſtom'd to, and have found benefit from.

            <p>I believe and am confident that the Doctor is much miſtaken in that point alſo: Honeſt Men, and Conſcientious Phyſicians look more principally at <hi>the curing their Patients,</hi> than <hi>doubling their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Honeſty</hi> is <hi>the trueſt Honour,</hi> maugre all that the Good Doctor would infer to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He will gain and keep to himſelf Patients,</hi>

               <hi>who have diſeales they are unwilling ſhould be known by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries and their boyes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſay in anſwer to this, that the Doctor may herein be ſtiled a <hi>Mountebank,</hi> as himſelf ſtiles th' Apothecaries: but if he do but Print his Bills, and make his man poſt them up in ſeveral places of note, ſignifying his name, and where his lodging is, and the hours of the day when he may be ſpoke with, and the diſeaſes that he cures with ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy as Mounte-banks uſe to do, he may I preſume have as much practice as the beſt of them all.</p>
            <p>The Doctor goes on ſtill and tells you,<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>47.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>the great intereſt that Apothecaries have in families will decay for their petty officiouſneſſes (which Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have put them upon;) Theſe will be taught Nurſes, and the Aſſiſtants, &amp;c.]</hi> Now the Good
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99906:18"/>Doctor hath alter'd the ſcene. What! Is the Doctor wheel'd about to collogue Nurſes that in his Frontiſpice hath ſhuffled in <hi>Nutrix</hi> and <hi>Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copoeus</hi> into his Diſtich amongſt the tribe of <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks,</hi> which are not found in th' Original, as I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before in my Animadverſion upon it? But any tooth (good Barber!) Rather than he will not unrooſt th' Apothecary, he will ſet up the Nurſes Cock a hoop, and chuſe them for his mates, but this is not ſo prudently done; <hi>ſi non Caſtè, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Cautè,</hi> Good Doctor. But there is a ſort of perſons that need to have good Memories; I perceive the Docter had forgot his Title Page. Nevertheleſs, <hi>as for the great Intereſt that Apothecaries have in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies for their petty Officiouſneſſes</hi> (as the good Doctor calls it) <hi>which Phyſicians have put them upon,</hi> his hopes are, that <hi>that will decay</hi> by this his new Project (though his Expedient be but weak, and ſuch as relliſhes more of paſſion, and ſelf intereſt.) Yet thus much I muſt ingeniouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that Apothecaries may in the main be better employed at home in their own ſhops in looking after the preparations of Medicines for the Patients, and do them as good if not better ſervice in their ſhops, than at their Lodgings, by viſiting, and might thereby ſave a conſiderable charge in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fewer Servants. But ſome are partly enforced to it to preſerve their acquaintance, which otherwiſe might poſſibly be taken from them by the Phyſician, if they ſhould not ſometimes appear; and beſides ſome Patients will think themſelves ſlighted, and neglected, if they ſhould wholly abſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99906:18"/>And therefore, if the good Doctor can find out a <hi>Medium</hi> by any honeſt Expedient, or by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more care of the Patient himſelf to excuſe th' Apothecary this trouble, he may do a good piece of ſervice both to Patient and Apothecary.</p>

               </note> whom formerly he had entituled the <hi>Credulous Sex, believing creatures,</hi> and ſo now will endeavour to make that uſe of them to believe all to be truth which comes out of his mouth; but I preſume they will be wary, and take heed whom they truſt, and remember how their great Grandame <hi>Eve</hi> was deceived, and by whom, even by the Grand Criminator.</p>
            <p>The Good Doctor ſeems to anſwer an Objection,<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>64.</hi>
               </note> that the great expence of time in preparing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines will keep them from this courſe; and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is, that <hi>a Phyſician needs not to ſpend much more than half an hour in a day one with another on this work, and may faſter diſpence them, than Apothecaries to Hoſpitals, who in an afternoon can provide for an hundred or two hundred ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and carry them, and diſpoſe them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now how this humour of vapouring ſhould ſuit with his extraordinary care of preparing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for the Good of his Patients, I am to ſeek.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:99906:19"/>
But poſſibly the Good Doctor may think I ſpeak without book, and therefore may ſooth himſelf up in his imaginary confidence, what he can do in that half hour. I ſhall therefore herein refer him to that gentleman of his own faculty, <hi>Accompl. Ph.</hi> who in his <hi>Pag.</hi> 54, 55, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hath candidly recited the <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> and <hi>Impoſſibilities</hi> of it, — which are too large for me to inſert here, though they be worth the peruſing.</p>
            <p>But grant that ſuch a thing might be done in ſo ſhort a time (which is a thing abſolutely impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Worthy Doctor to compaſs) doth he purpoſe to cure his Patients as they do in Hoſpitals, and Alms houſes? this will <hi>malè audire.</hi> Such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients as you deſire, Good Doctor, will not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with their Fees for an Hoſpital Cure.</p>
            <p>Another Objection which the Doctor ſeems to anſwer is, that the Apothecaries rail at this courſe which is undertaken by this Good Doctor, and ſay <hi>it will undoe them.</hi> His anſwer to this is that <hi>if needs one or other muſt be ruin'd, 'tis more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that th' Apothecary ſhould ſuffer than the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> —] To this I reply, that if there be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that one or other muſt be ruin'd, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is but conſonant to reaſon and impartial Juſtice <hi>ſuum cuique tribuere,</hi> (that the Saddle may be ſet upon the right horſe) that the firſt Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator of the deſign'd miſchief and Artifice be the perſon fitteſt to ſuffer. — <hi>Nec enim lex juſtior ulla eſt, quam necis artifices arte perire ſuâ.</hi> There will not need any great inquiſition about the perſon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99906:20"/>entitled to it: neither can the Apothecary ſay, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram quem quaeritis adſum.</hi> But however I hope that there may be ſome <hi>Medium</hi> of Reconciliation whereby neither one or other may be ruin'd, We muſt forget and forgive; For when we have done all by Criminating and Recriminating, <hi>bonas horas malè collocando,</hi> 't will come to this point at laſt; as <hi>Aeneas</hi> to his Father <hi>Anchiſes,</hi>

            <p>Both Societies are Embarqu'd in one Bottom, ſo as if one ſink, th'other is not like to expect much ſafety. And there may be ſome people poſſibly in the world, ſo ill natur'd, that whilſt we are at this feud &amp; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference amongſt our ſelves, may clap their hands and cry, <hi>Eja Socrates, eja Xantippe, fight dog, fight bear;</hi> Therefore under favour I conceive, it will be the great joynt intereſt of both Societies to preſerve and maintain each others well-fare in their ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Capacities,

            <p>For in ſumme that the Phyſician of himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of the Apothecary ſhould pretend to the compounding, and adminiſtring of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to the Patient, or that the Apothecary of his own head, in any caſe of danger or difficulty, ſhould dare to undertake the Cure of the Patient without conſulting the Phyſician, I conceive that nor one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99906:20"/>nor other of them doth therein diſcharge the duty incumbent upon them; neither can they expect, in any probability, much good ſucceſs, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by their joynt compliance they might,

But thoſe Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, that for reaſons cannot, nor will not take this courſe, are to be admoniſh'd (delphinem natare doce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.) to doe here as the Phyſicians did in</hi> France, <hi>for the good of the people,</hi> viz. <hi>to tell the Patients the prices of their Medicines, and to write their Bills in</hi> Engliſh &amp;c.] <hi>Cui bono?</hi> What will the Good Doctor gain by that? <hi>Manum de tabula</hi>— Hands off Good Doctor! Not too much upon that ſtring, if you love your own intereſt. But let me mind the Doctor of what one of the Learnedſt Phyſicians of <hi>France, Renodaeus,</hi> adviſeth, in his <hi>Inſtitut.

Rather than not be revenged on the <hi>Philiſtin</hi> Apothecary, he will be as valiant as <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:99906:21"/>and doe his utmoſt to pull the fabrick down upon his own head, as well as upon his enemies, and to ſacrifice his own life in the ruines. Brave, Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick, <hi>Roman</hi> valour! What cares he for his life, ſo he may but do his Countreymen &amp; Mankind good, and withall be reveng'd on th' uncircumcis'd Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>the Common Enemy,</hi> as he tearms him, for the loſs of his Eyes? And indeed the Good Doctor may poſſibly be <hi>oculis (vel ſaltem mente) captus,</hi> he hath taken his mark ſo much amiſs, and may find hereafter by experience, that when he undertook this task, of <hi>Raking,</hi> as he calls it, into the faults of Apothecaries, <hi>he took a wrong Sow by the Ear,</hi> as we uſe to ſay in plain <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for any <hi>Arcanum of the Phyſicians own prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I conceive the Company have not to object againſt it, if it be not prepared and made uſe of <hi>de induſtriâ</hi> to confine the Patient to his own Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, or to divert the Patient from ſuch an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary as he deſires; Nor can I believe that any ingenious Apothecary entruſted with ſuch an <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> will require much profit from any other bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apothecary, that may have occaſion to make uſe of it. However I am not of the opinion that a Phyſician is, or can be, oblig'd to make uſe of any ſuch Apothecary, as he finds juſt exceptions againſt, and can make it appear by falſifying his preſcript, or other manifeſt neglect, but rather conceive that the Phyſicians liberty may poſſibly reduce ſuch an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary to his duty and make him honeſt. For how can the Phyſician expect, that (though himſelf preſcribe the beſt and moſt proper Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99906:22"/>that upon mature conſideration he can) if th' Apothecary be not honeſt and conſcientious, as well as able, to make uſe of ſuch Ingredients as are ſound, and carefully prepar'd, or for lucre uſe ſuch things as are exolete, or decay'd, how can (I ſay) the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician expect any good ſucceſs out of ſuch a ſhop for his Patients recovery. But ſuch declining of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary I ſuppoſe the Phyſician ought to have good grounds for, and to have withall the Patients aſſent in it, if th' Apothecary be one, whom the Patients themſelves make choice of. And as for the high Language that ſome others have uſed againſt th' Apothecaries, if their intentions be only to reſtrain th' Apothecaries from the Profeſſed cuſtomary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing of Phyſick, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſome of them ſeem to intimate, I ſhall not be willing to take cognizance of it. But yet good Language provokes not; and ſoft fire makes ſweet Malt, as we ſay,
<q>Flectitur obſequio curvatus ab arbore ramus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can I judge it reaſonable that an Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who is entruſted with any <hi>Arcanum</hi> from a Phyſician, ſhould to the prejudice of the Inventor communicate this without his conſent to any other perſon, and thereby become a failer of truſt, which amongſt the reſt is one of the Crimes laid to his charge.</p>
            <p>And now having with what modeſt, calm and plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> I could, endeavoured to vindicate the aſperſed Company, I intended to have ſtruck off; but that I find ſome other Pamphlets of the Good
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99906:22"/>Doctor's flying abroad, amongſt which I obſerve that his reply to <hi>H.S.</hi> caſts more dirt upon the Company of Apothecaries, which I ſhall endeavour to wipe off in a word or two before I leave him.

<q>Tunc tua res agitur, paries cum proximus ardet.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When your Neighbours houſe is on fire, then <hi>Medice Cura teipſum,</hi> 'tis high time to look to your own, and to take care of your own affairs, Good Doctor. If th' Apothecary march in the Van, then 'tis but reaſon that ſome other Perſon ſhould have the honour to bring up the Rere, and what perſon more fit for that than ſuch a one, who <hi>propter ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum &amp; vaniloquentiam,</hi> for his bawling and chanting may be juſtly entitled to it? The Good Doctor ſeconds the Satyrical Poet with a paſſage out of the famous and moſt eloquent Orator <hi>Cicero pro A. Cluentio,</hi> who made mention of a <hi>Pharmacopola Circumforaneus,</hi> who poiſoned a Citizens wife of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ran away: <hi>but he was no Roman.</hi> Yet let me tell the Doctor thus much, by his Good favour, that neither the <hi>Pharmacopolae</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:99906:24"/>mentioned by <hi>Horace,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Pharmacopola Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumforaneus</hi> mentioned by <hi>Cicero,</hi> which he alſo quotes here, can in any rational man's apprehenſion be conſtrued to be <hi>Pharmacopoeus,</hi> the ſhop-Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, but rather ſome Common Mountebanks, that made it their Trades <hi>circumforare,</hi> to go from one good Market Town to another, and there to mount the Stage to deceive the people, <hi>ſi populus vult decipi;</hi> Nor poſſibly may they be without their Troops of Pipers and Fidlers and Tinkers Trulls and Gypſies to follow the Camp, ſuch as the Good Doctor hath ranked with them in the Van. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, <hi>But he was no</hi> Roman, and by conſequence, or in all probability, no Apothecary, which acted that <hi>Veneſical Moeris</hi>'s part upon a Citizen's wife of <hi>Rome.</hi> But,

            </p>
            <p>Further I obſerve, that the Good Doctor, in one of his late pieces, <hi>beggs pardon of all Learned men, eſpecially thoſe of his own Art, that</hi> he hath <hi>conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended ſo low, as to cope with ſuch unworthy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, hoping that</hi> his <hi>Zeal for</hi> his <hi>Profeſſion may excuſe him.</hi>] (I wiſh he were not a greater Zealot for kindling Coals! I ſuppoſe the fire might have been extinguiſh'd before this, had it not been for his bellows.) 'Tis true, <hi>Aquila non captat Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcas, nec capit Elephantus mures.</hi> The Eagle ſoars aloft, and catches not at flies, and this high-flown Doctor thinks it a great diſparagement and much
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99906:24"/>below him to contend with ſuch contemptible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, the ſpawn and refuſe of all. But Good Doctor, <hi>Nec ſum adeo informis.—Nec omnium die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Pharmacopoeis occiderunt Soles.</hi> They are no ſuch deſpicable creatures as this Doctor would make them. I am ſure they are not ſo reputed in Forreign parts, nor have been ſo character'd abroad; they are numbred there amongſt the Chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Citizens, as <hi>Bartholomaeus Maranta,</hi> that Learn'd and Famous Phyſician of <hi>Naples,</hi> in his Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Commentary of <hi>Theriaca</hi> and <hi>Mithridate</hi> to <hi>Ferdinandus Imperatus</hi> then Apothecary of the ſame place (which I hinted before) witneſſeth. So alſo Learned <hi>Schroeder,</hi> before his <hi>Pharmacopoeia Medico-Chymica</hi> (than which there is not, I conceive, a more Polite and Candid piece extant upon that Subject,) I ſay, this Phyſician (who was <hi>Archiater,</hi> Phyſician in Chief to the Republick of <hi>Franckford</hi>) did not diſdain to conſecrate (as he tearms it,) that his piece to the Apothecaries of that place, whom he is pleaſed to mention <hi>nominatim,</hi> and to ſtile them in the front of an Epiſtle to them before his book, not diſhonourably. I could name others of the ſame nature, as <hi>Petrus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ffenbachius</hi> one other of the Chief Phyſicians of <hi>Franckford,</hi> in his <hi>Prooemium</hi> to the publication of <hi>Renodoeus</hi>'s Diſpenſatory, and <hi>Quercetan's;</hi> with ſome others, but I paſs them.</p>
            <p>But 'tis probable the Good Doctor did not think any body durſt be ſo Bold and Sawcy, as to queſtion any thing that came from him, being <hi>A Fellow of the Colledge</hi> (for he bears himſelf up ſtill upon that foundation, as <hi>page</hi> 31. of his Reply to <hi>H. S.</hi> where
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99906:25"/>he ſaith, <hi>All civil men of the faculty would have thought, a Fellow of the Colledge his affirmation had been ſufficient enough againſt a practiſing Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary without putting the Caſe at all.</hi>] A Compleat piece of Juſtice! Great <hi>Pompey</hi> like with his high Language in the Senate-houſe,<note place="margin">Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch.</note> 
               <hi>Si ſolum pede pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavero, plenam exercitibus totam reddam Italiam.</hi> So the Good Doctor if he do but ſtamp on the ground with his foot, nay, if he do but ſay the word, it is argument enough <hi>(nemine contradicente)</hi> to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the poor Potecary, &amp; to have a whole Army of Phyſicians at his beck. And what I pray, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his grandiloquy in the Senate-houſe, was that Great <hi>Pompey</hi>'s end? After his utter defeat at the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> battel, flying into <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Ptolemy</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, <hi>Mortui non mordent,</hi> put an end to his days. But he tells you, <hi>Examples enough may be ſhown phyſicians ſo doing.</hi> I believe, Good Doctor, you forget your ſelf, and therein aſperſe the Honourable Colledge, who have more Candor and Ingenuity in them than to aſſume any ſuch unlimited power, which no law doth, or can allow. And I fear you will be at a loſs to produce any one ſuch Example; and if you ſhould be able to produce it, I muſt take the boldneſs to tell you, that it would prove little better than <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> at beſt: Take therefore in anſwer to yours, One Example, for all, out of Sacred Authentick Record, which will hold water, when yours ſhall not, and 'tis this. If the <hi>Idumean</hi> Prince (for ſo it appears in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ that he was the greateſt man in all the Eaſt) thought it a Crime of a high nature, and ſuch as might bring a juſt Judgement from heaven upon

            <p>As to the Good Doctors being pleas'd in his late piece to make himſelf merry in putting the <hi>Wittall</hi> and <hi>Cuckold</hi> ſo facetiouſly upon the Apothecaries, I ſhall not give either him, or my ſelf any trouble to anſwer, but ſhall leave it to the Learned Pen of ſome <hi>Good Apothecaries Phyſician,</hi> as he tearms them, (whoſe joynt concern it is) and who may better know how to treat the Doctor, but all in ſome convenient time. In the <hi>interim</hi> let the good Doctor enjoy himſelf in that his mirth. For which his piece of Merry Drollery I wiſh him a Merry New Year, and that is all the harm I wiſh him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this my diſcourſe with a paſſage out of that Learned, and famous Phyſician of <hi>Paris, Renodoeus,</hi> in his <hi>Inſtitut. Phamaceutic. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>De praeparat. differentiis.</hi> Where having treated of ſeveral Chymical preparations he proceeds thus. <hi>Verùm relictis, &amp;c. But leaving the Chymical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, which it is often better to know, than to try, or experiment, let us purſue the wonted prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Medicines, and the wholſome Remedies of the princes of Phyſicians, which every body may with ſecurity and without fear of danger make uſe of for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99906:27"/>the expelling of diſeaſes, and the preſerving of health. Of which ſort are ſuch as are daily, openly, and before all mens eyes prepar'd by th' Apothecaries: and are either for preſent occaſion, or for ſome lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time kept in their ſhops. For of theſe as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the exigent occaſion requires, the Phyſician one while makes choice of theſe Remedies, another while of thoſe, and how much, and how prepar'd may be convenient for the driving away of this or that diſeaſe, he preſcribes.</hi> Non verò parat, ne<expan>

Which thing ſeeing it is ſo Impious, or Wicked, the Apothecary muſt of neceſſity be inſtituted or appointed, who may after the accuſtomed manner prepare Medicines, and keep them for future uſes, as well as for preſent occaſions.</hi>
